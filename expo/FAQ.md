### 4. How do I register a poster for this event?
Please visit [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l51Ay6th4UKMZnvnDxR_UuI_77eiaFY4H1-9bizaOZY) to register.

**NOTE**:
- (1). It is better to register as soon as possible since currently we can only accommodate around 65 in-person posters (with a potential overflow of about 10 more). Early registration will help us plan accordingly.
- (2) You don’t need to have a poster ready at the time of registration. Simply provide preliminary information when registering. You can update the details and upload a digital copy later.
- (3). One poster per person
- (4). Poster locations in the 2B area are numbered. You may walk around, check the poster labels near your office, and request a nearby poster number. We will consider your request but cannot guarantee it.
- (5) Virtual posters do not need to fill in columns C, D, G, H, and I of the registration form.

### 5. I want to attend the EXPO but will not be presenting a poster. Do I still need to register?
No. Only folks who are planning on presenting a poster need to register. Anyone is welcome to participate as a poster viewer without registering.

### 6. Why are there two presentation windows on the registration sheet?
There will be two windows available to present posters. The goal of this configuration is to give poster presenters the opportunity to view other posters during the window when they are not presenting.

### 7. What types of posters can I submit?
Any type of poster is welcome! Whether it's a recent AMS or AGU poster, an important past poster, a new poster showcasing your recent research advances, innovative ideas, or even a non-science poster like one highlighting the NeverBlue group—you name it!

We will collaborate with the GSL poster print service to ensure your posters are printed on time.
